# Weather-App

Welcome,  my first front end app using react and a API. 
It was exciting back then to see something you coded <i>actually</i> work,
And now I'm ready to show you all how this app works and how my first steps
as a developer started.

This is the main screen (I'm showing the mobile version, but you can access from any device!):

</p>

From there, you can access the search bar and type the name of any city you want to check the weather of.

This app gets information from the [accuWeather](https://developer.accuweather.com) API and renders it into cards
which were made using React, CSS and Bootstrap:

</p>

(You can search up to 15 cities and see all the cards at the same time!)

When clicked, the name of each city will lead you to a "Detail card", 
where you can access more information about the weather of that location.

</p>

(I remember how hard it was back then to convert the sunset and sunrise times, since they come in Unix format
and I needed it in JavaScript timestamp!)

Finally, you can check the <i>about</i> section to know about me, my social media and the rest of my projects!

I hope you liked it!
